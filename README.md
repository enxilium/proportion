## Motivation

The urgency that comes with the limited time we are lucky to have on this earth is essential. It's our driving force to wake up every day and do something with that day. In the difficulties of life however, we often forget this important but grim motivator. Hence, [ProportionAl](https://proportionai.xyz/) was born. It's an AI productivity app that on onboarding of a user, tells them how much time they really have after discounting all of the distractions and responsibilities in their life.

Afterwards, it gives them visual representations of how they've been spending them time on the day to day, where they can submit, remove and update surveys and forms (CRUD operations).
